My name is Kimia Noorbakhsh, and I am a last-year Bachelor of Science student in [computer engineering](https://ce.sharif.edu/) at Sharif University of Technology (SUT). I completed my Bachelors thesis project entitled "Robustness Improvement of 3D Deep Neural Networks Against Adversarial Attacks by Training with Denoised Data" under the supervision of [Dr. Shohreh Kasaei](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=mvx4PvgAAAAJ&hl=en) at the Image Processing Lab ([IPL, SUT](http://ipl.ce.sharif.edu/)).

I am currently a scientific intern at [IST Austria](https://ist.ac.at/en/home/), where I am very fortunate to be advised by [Dr. Dan Alistarh](https://people.csail.mit.edu/alistarh/). Last summer, I did my first research intenrship at the [Max Planck Institute for Software Systems](https://www.mpi-sws.org/) where I had the great pleasure to work with [Dr. Manuel Gomez Rodriguez](https://people.mpi-sws.org/~manuelgr/).

I am also a remote undergraduate research assistant at [AISYS Lab](https://pooyanjamshidi.github.io/AISys/), greatful to work under the supervision of [Dr. Pooyan Jamshidi](https://pooyanjamshidi.github.io/).

My main areas of interest include
- Causal and Statistical Inference (MPI-SWS)
- Transfer Learning (ISTA, AISYS (UofSC))
- Adversarial Machine Learning (IPL (SUT))

Previously I have worked on
- Graph theory and Graph Search Algorithms (SUT)

**Trivia**
- In my non-academic life, I enjoy swimming and skiing. I am a professional swimmer with more than ten years of experience in top national teams and competitions.
