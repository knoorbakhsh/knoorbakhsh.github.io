I am Kimia, a second-year PhD student at MIT's Electrical Engineering and Computer Science department ([MIT EECS](https://www.eecs.mit.edu/)), and a member of the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory ([CSAIL](https://www.csail.mit.edu/)). I am very fortunate to be working with [Professor Mohammad Alizadeh](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=6_cxCKQAAAAJ) and [Professor Hari Balakrishnan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Qf4bw4UAAAAJ&hl=en) in the Networking and Mobile Systems group. Before MIT, I earned my B.Sc. degree in Computer Engineering from [Sharif University of Technology](https://ce.sharif.edu/).

My research interests lie in the area of Large Language Models and Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning for Computer Networks, and Causal Inference.

During my undergraduate studies, I was very fortunate to work with [Professor Manuel Gomez Rodriguez](https://people.mpi-sws.org/~manuelgr/), [Professor Dan Alistarh](https://people.csail.mit.edu/alistarh/), [Professor Pooyan Jamshidi](https://pooyanjamshidi.github.io/), and [Professor Shohreh Kasaei](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=mvx4PvgAAAAJ&hl=en).

 I have experience working on
- Causal and Statistical Inference (at [MPI-SWS](https://www.mpi-sws.org/))
- Sparse Transfer Learning (at [ISTA](https://ista.ac.at/en/home/))
- Deep Learning for Symbolic Mathematics (at [AISYS Lab](https://pooyanjamshidi.github.io/AISys/))
- Adversarial Machine Learning (at Sharif University of Technology)
- Graph theory and Graph Search Algorithms (at Sharif University of Technology)


**Trivia**
- In my non-academic life, I enjoy swimming and skiing. I am a professional swimmer (3 times national champion) with more than ten years of experience in top national teams and competitions.
