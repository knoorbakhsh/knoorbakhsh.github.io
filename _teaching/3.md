Course description:
======
In this course, the student is introduced to algorithm analysis methods, simple and slightly advanced but essential data structures, and some introductory algorithms. In presenting the contents of this course, the emphasis is on analyzing and proving the correctness of algorithms. The student should already be familiar with one of the C ++ or Java programming languages and recursive methods for solving problems.
