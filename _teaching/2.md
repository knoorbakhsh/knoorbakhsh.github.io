Course description:
======
This course aims to acquaint students with the concepts, structures, and techniques of discrete mathematics that are widely used in computer science and engineering. Develop essential skills such as understanding and constructing accurate mathematical proofs, creative thinking in problem-solving, familiarity with basic results in logic, combinations, probabilities, number theory, graph theory, and computational theory, and providing the mathematical prerequisites needed for many other courses offered in various fields of engineering and computer science are the objectives of this course.
