Course description:
======
This course is a gentle introduction to the concepts and methodologies in Artificial Intelligence from both theoretical and practical perspectives. This includes designing intelligent agents through state-space search methods, knowledge representation and inference, and Machine Learning. At the end of this course, students are expected to be able to develop intelligent solutions for semi-real world problems through appropriate methods that are discussed in the class. Furthermore, they are expected to gain knowledge and experience to analyze the inner-working of the methods and customize them for specific problems.
